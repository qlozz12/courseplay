		<h1>Manual <span id="manualVersion">valid for v4.00</span></h1>

		<hr />

		<article class="manualSection" id="intro">
			<p>This manual aims to describe the Courseplay hud, the changeable settings, and the different drive modes. Most likely, there will be one or the other thing missing.</p>
			<p>If you find a topic not dealt with in this manual, please let us know.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- #################### -->

		<article class="manualSection" id="controls">
			<h2>Controls</h2>
			<p>In general, controlling Courseplay works with the mouse, due to free keys in Farming Simulator being rather rare. By using the <span class="emphasize1">right mouse button</span> the Courseplay hud, where you can configure the drivers, is activated. In addition, a couple of functions like starting and stopping the driving are available for the keyboard, by using the keys <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd>+<kbd title="Keypad 7">KP 7</kbd> through <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd>+<kbd title="Keypad 9">KP 9</kbd>. In the hud you can switch the opening/closing the hud to using the keyboard (default: <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd>+<kbd title="Delete">DELETE</kbd>).</p>
			<p>Both the keyboard and the mouse buttons can be configured in the game's options menu.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- #################### -->
		<!-- HUD -->

		<article class="manualSection" id="hud">
			<h2>HUD</h2>
			<p>When opening the hud, the mouse controls are activated automatically. Meaning, you can not use the mouse to look around anymore. In order to deactivate the mouse controls, you need to click the right mouse button again. Alternatively you can click on the <span class="icon-close inline" title="close button"></span> in the upper right corner of the hud. Doing so closes the hud and deactivates the mouse controls.</p>
			<p>The hud is divided into multiple pages. You can navigate through those by clicking on the respective page icon at the very top. The pages' titles are displayed as a tooltip. Keep in mind the certain pages are deactivated while you're in a certain mode.</p>
			<p>In the center section on each page, a multitude of settings and options can be set and commands be given, simply by clicking on the chosen action or its corresponding buttons <span class="icon-plus inline" title="plus"></span>/<span class="icon-minus inline" title="minus"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowUp inline" title="arrow up"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowDown inline" title="arrow down"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowLeft inline" title="left arrow"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowRight inline" title="right arrow"></span> with the <span class="emphasize1">left mouse button</span>. Certain values and settings like scrolling through the course list, the settings of widths, speeds oder percentages etc. can be altered in bigger steps by pressing the <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd> key while clicking on the buttons. Some values and areas (like the course list) also accept the mouse wheel. This is indicated by a mouse wheel icon appearing next to the mouse cursor.</p>
			<p>In the bottom part of the hud you'll find information about the driver, the loaded course and the current status.</p>

				HUD: Combine controls
			</h2>
			<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>This page is only accessable from combines, choppers, harvesters and tractors with attached combines or choppers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li data-line="1">
					<h4>Request driver / Driver requested</h4>
					<p>Call a driver manually. If a driver has found the combine and is on his way, the name will be displayed.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-line="2">
					<h4>Start/stop driver</h4>
					<p>Manually start or stop the current driver. If stopped, the driver will wait until being called to start again.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-line="3">
					<h4>Send driver home</h4>
					<p>Manually send the current driver to follow his course. He will drive the course, unload/overload, and drive on to his first waypoint.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-line="4">
					<h4>Driver side</h4>
					<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only displayed for choppers</p>
					<p>By default, the drivers choose the fitting (non fruit) side to drive by and unload a chopper. With this option you can hard code a side of your choice where they should drive (e.g. when you're threshing a field manually in a spiral).</p>
				</li>
				<li data-line="4">
					<h4>Driver priority</h4>
					<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only displayed for combines and harvesters (not choppers)</p>
					<p>When multiple drivers should unload a combine or harvester, this option defines with which priority the drivers are called.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="emphasize1">Fill level:</span> The driver with the highest fill level will be called first, no matter the distance to the combine.</li>
						<li><span class="emphasize1">Distance:</span> The driver closest to the combine will be called first.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li data-line="5">
					<h4>Turning maneuver</h4>
					<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only displayed for choppers, only when they're in manual mode (i.e. not in helper or field work mode)</p>
					<p>Manually tell the current driver that you're now starting your turning maneuver. The driver will drive out of your way and turn as well. Clicking it again tells the driver he can now return and continue unloading the chopper.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-line="5">
					<h4>Stop during unloading</h4>
					<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only displayed for combines and harvesters (not choppers) in "field work" mode</p>
					<p>When activated, the combine will stop during the unloading process until it's empty.</p>

				<h3>No course loaded</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Start recording</h4>
						<p>With this option, Courseplay's recording mode is activated. You can drive and record the course that the driver should use later. When recording is active, you can deactivate mouse controls by clicking the right mouse button, so you can look around while driving and recording.</p>
						<p>See: <span class="emphasize2">"Recording mode"</span></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Calculate current field's edge path</h4>
						<!-- TODO <p>See also: <a href="#" class="internal">field scanner</a></p> -->
						<p>While standing on a field, the field's edge/border path can be scanned. It is then displayed as blue lines and yellow dots (can be toggled with <span class="icon-eye inline"></span>).</p>
						<p>If you want to save the edge path, choose a new field number for it with <span class="icon-arrowUp inline"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowDown inline"></span>. If a field edge path with that number already exists, you can overwrite it, otherwise your can add the path to the list.</p>
						<p>Each manually scanned field is saved in the <code>courseplayFields.xml</code> file and loaded with the savegame.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Recording mode</h3>
				<p>During the recording of a course, Each newly recorded waypoint will be displayed with an orange pyramid dummy. Multiple buttons are displayed that let you influence the waypoints' settings. The buttons' functions are displayed as a tooltip when hovering over them.</p>
				<p>You should make sure to go more or less straight until reaching the third waypoint.</p>
				<p>The recorded course is only temporary: the next time you start the savegame, it will be gone, unless you save it first. (See: <a href="#hud_manageCourses" class="internal"><span class="icon-page2"></span> Manage courses</a>)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingStop"></span>Stop recording</h4>
						<p>When reaching the end point of your route, use "stop recording". It is advised to have the end point ca. 5 to 10 m before the start point, and for it to have about the same direction as the start point. Meaning: don't stop at a south direction while the course's start direction is north.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingPause"></span>Pause recording</h4>
						<p>Pause the current recording. This option is only available after the third waypoint. A yellow arrow will be displayed, showing the direction to the last waypoint. Click the pause button again to continue. In addition, while paused you can delete the last waypoint (see <span class="emphasize2">"delete last waypoint"</span>).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingDeleteWaypoint"></span>Delete last waypoint</h4>
						<p>This option is only available when the recording is paused. The current last waypoint is deleted. You can repeat this until only three waypoints are left.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-waitPointSign"></span>Set waiting point</h4>
						<p>While recording, you have the possibility to set waiting points on the course. At those points, the driver, while driving the course, will stop and wait until either you tell him to continue, or the configured <a href="#hud_generalSettings" class="internal">waiting time</a> has passed. When a driver reaches a waiting point, a message will be displayed (<code>XYZ has reached waiting point.</code>).</p>
						<p>In certain modes, waiting points have special meanings, other than waiting: in the <a href="#driveMode4" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode4single"></span> fertilizer/seeding</a> and <a href="#driveMode6" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode6single"></span> field work</a> modes, they indicate the start and end of the work area, and - if using a bale loader - the unloading point. In the <a href="#driveMode9" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode9single"></span> shovel filling and unloading</a> mode, they indicate the start and end of the loading area and the unloading point.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-crossSign"></span>Set crossing point</h4>
						<p>Crossing points are "signal" or "combination points" where two separate courses can be combined (see <a href="#hud_manageCourses" class="internal"><span class="icon-page2"></span> Manage courses</a>). In both courses, two crossing points (one in each course) that are closer to each other than 50 metres are determined. The combined course will lead up until the first course's crossing point, and from there go the second course from its respective crossing point.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="../../res/img/manual_mergeCourse_en.jpg" class="infoImg">
							<figcaption>Combination of two courses at their crossing points</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p><span class="emphasize1">Note:</span> A course's start and stop points are automatically set as crossing points. Hence, they don't have to be manually declared as those when recording.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingTurn"></span>Start/finish turn maneuver</h4>
						<p>While it is generally advised to have field courses generated, they can also be recorded manually. Setting the turn maneuver later tells the driver to do a turn maneuver on his own at this point - meaning lifting and/or turning off the tool. Clicking once activates the turn maneuver (the button turns green), clicking it again ends it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingReverse"></span>Reverse driving</h4>
						<p>Courseplay supports reverse driving with trailers in many modes. Activating this option later tells the driver to drive this portion of the course in reverse. You should only activate and deactivate it once you're at a complete stop and not rolling anymore. When active during the recording, you must drive in reverse, otherwise there will be severe driving errors later. Clicking once activates the reverse mode (the button turns green), clicking it again ends it.</p>

						<!-- TODO link to that section here -->
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Course loaded, not driving</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Drive course</h4>
						<p>When you have recorded or loaded a course, you can "hire" a driver to have him drive the course. From this moment on, you won't have any manual control over the tractor until you stop the driver.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Start course at&hellip;</h4>
						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Available in all modes except "Fill and empty shovel"</p>
						<p>Some courses have relatively many waypoints in a small area, especially at the starting point (e.g. generated courses with headland). Here you can choose if the driver starts the course at the nearest waypoint (default setting), the current wapypoint or directly at the first waypoint.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Farm silo load</h4>
						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only available in grain transport mode</p>
						<p>With this option you can choose the silo fruit type to be filled into the trailer at the course's start point. Each tractor can have a different selected fill type, allowing for multiple different routes from that silo running at the same time. This setting is saved in the <code>vehicles.xml</code> file.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Change mode</h4>
						<p><span class="icon-mode1block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode2block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode3block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode4block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode5block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode6block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode7block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode8block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span> <span class="icon-mode9block" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span></p>
						<p>In order to being able to do many different work types, there are different driving modes. Certain modes are only available for certain types of vehicles. For example, a tractor won't be allowed to drive in the <a href="#driveMode7" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode7single"></span> combine self unloading</a> mode. The current mode will be highlighted in green. The mode names are display as a tooltip when hovering over the buttons.</p>
						<p>The different modes are described in detail in the <a class="internalTab" href="#driveModes">Driving modes</a> section.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-clearCourse"></span>Clear course</h4>
						<p>When a course has been recorded or loaded, you can delete the current course selection. The saved course will not be deleted from the save game, only the driver will clear his current course.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-search"></span>Search for first waypoint</h4>
						<p>With this option activated, the direction and distance to the course's first waypoint (in relation to the tractor) are displayed. This can be useful if you don't remember where the course's start is.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Course loaded, driving</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Stop driver</h4>
						<p>Of course you can always stop the activated driver. Later, when reactivating the driver, it will continue from the next valid waypoint.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Drive now</h4>
						<p>When you're driving a "filling" course, for example unloading a combine in combi mode, or collecting grass in field work mode, you can force the driver to drive the unloading portion of the route immediately.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Continue</h4>
						<p>When a driver has reached a waiting point, you can manually tell him to continue.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Stop at last point or trigger</h4>
						<p>When activated, the tractor will stop at the next valid unloading or fill trigger, or - if no triggers exist on that route - at the end of the route.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Ridge markers</h4>
						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Available only in "fertilizing and seeding" mode</p>
						<p>When using a seeder with a generated course, choose whether the ridge markers should be deployed automatically or manually (i.e. you control them). This setting is saved in the <code>vehicles.xml</code> file.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Unloading on field</h4>
						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Available only in "field work" mode, with an attached bale loader and with <span class="emphasize3">no unloading course</span> existing after the field work course</p>

			</h2>
			<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>This page is displayed in all modes except "Transfer", "Field work" and "Fill and empty shovel".</p>
			<p>Just like the name implies, these settings are for the combi and overload modes. You can configure your driver to be better suited to unload the combine. In addition there is one option for the "fertilizer/seeding" and "liquid manure transport" modes. The values can be changed by clicking the <span class="icon-plus inline" title="plus"></span>/<span class="icon-minus inline" title="minus"></span> buttons on the right hand side (bigger steps with pressed <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd> key) or the mouse wheel.</p>

					<h4>Path finding</h4>
					<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>Only available in "combi" and "overload" modes</p>
					<p>When activated, the driver tries as best as possible not to drive through the fruit. On the one hand this means that on the way to the combine/chopper he drives around the fruit. On the other hand it means that he won't drive to unload a combine if the combine's pipe is on the fruit pipe.

			<h2><span class="icon-mode3single"></span> Overloader</h2>
			<p>The overloader mode is somewhat similar to the combi mode, in that the driver unloads a combine. But instead of the driving a course to an unloading trigger, the driver overloads into a waiting trailer. As with the combi mode, a combine can be found automatically or set manually.</p>
			<p>The course's start point should be in proximity to a waiting trailer (e.g. another tractor in "driver helper" mode). From there, the course must lead to the trailer. When the overloader's pipe is above the waiting trailer (so when it's able to overload), a <span class="emphasize1">waiting point</span> needs to be set. Later, while driving the course, this waiting point tells the overloader to stop, extend the pipe, and start overloading. During, an info message <code>XYZ has reached overload point.</code> will be displayed. When the overloader is empty, the driver will continue the course and wait at the last waypoint for his next unloading operation.</p>
			<p>After the waiting point, the course needs to extend a little further (away from the trailer), ideally back to the start point.</p>

		<!-- ### DRIVEMODE4 ### -->
		<article class="manualSection" id="driveMode4">
			<h2><span class="icon-mode4single"></span> Fertilize and seeding</h2>
			<p>When fertilizing or seeding, there are two sections: one, the actual work part on the field, and two, the course from the field to the refilling trigger and back to the field.</p>
			<p>The field work course can be created in two different ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>You record the course yourself. It is important that there need to be two waiting points. The first one at the position where the work on the field should start, and the second at the position where the work on the field should end. This work area is absolutely necessary for the correct functioning of this mode.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The course can be generated automatically. For further information, see the <a class="internal" href="#generateCourse"><span class="icon-page8 inline"></span>Generate course</a> section. The waiting points will be set automatically.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second part, the automatic refilling, is a regular "A to B" course. It should start at the second waiting point (so, the end of the field work course), then go through the fertilizer/liquid manure/seeding trigger, and back to the field, ending just before the first waiting point of the field work course. As soon as a refilling trigger is recognized, the driver stops and refills automatically. If a tool isn't fillable via a trigger, but rather manually (e.g. a solid manure spreader or via a liquid manure transfer trailer), an additional waiting point has to be set and the point where the tool should be filled.</p>
			<p>When driving through a trigger or waiting at the refill waiting point, the driver will wait until the tool is filled with the percentage set in the <code>Refill until percentage</code> option (default: 100%, available on the <a href="#hud_mode2settings" class="internal"><span class="icon-page3 inline"></span>Combi mode settings</a> page) and then continue his course.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode5single"></span> Transfer</h2>
			<p>The transfer mode is the most simple form to get from A to B. It uses a completely regular course with a start and an end point. The driver blindly follows that course, without unloading or other fancy stuff. Reaching the end, the driver returns to the start point and repeats the course. If you want to prevent that, you need to activate the <code>Stop at last point or at next trigger</code> option.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode6single"></span> Field work</h2>
			<p>The field work mode is the work horse of all the different modes: it can be used for pressing and collecting bales, windrowing, teddering, cultivating, collecting grass or straw, and much more.</p>
			<p>Basically, it works much the same as the fertilizing/seeding mode, only that the tool needs to be emptied/unloaded instead of being refilled. Also, the work area must be defined between two waiting points; the unloading course needs to go through a corresponding trigger.</p>
			<p>As in the fertilizing/seeding mode, the field work course can be generated in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>You record the course yourself. It is important that there need to be two waiting points. The first one at the position where the work on the field should start, and the second at the position where the work on the field should end. This work area is absolutely necessary for the correct functioning of this mode.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The course can be generated automatically. For further information, see the <a class="internal" href="#generateCourse"><span class="icon-page8 inline"></span>Generate course</a> section. The waiting points will be set automatically.</p>
				</li>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode7single"></span> Combine self unloading</h2>

The combine will work as a helper until its fill level reaches the percentage set at <code>Start at %</code>. Then it drives to the course's start point, follows the course until the waiting point, where it will unload into a waiting trailer. After, it will follow the course until the end point, from where it will drive to the last position where it worked as a helper. Now, it will activate its cutter and continue threshing.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode8single"></span> Liquid manure transporter</h2>
			<p>The liquid manure transporting mode is for transporter barrels and similar tools that have an integrated liquid manure filling trigger. The tool is refilled at a liquid manure silo and then driven to a field's edge, where a working liquid manure barrel can refill automatically.</p>
			<p>It basically doesn't matter where the course begins or ends, only make sure of two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>The course must lead through a liquid manure trigger (e.g. liquid manure silo) so it can be refilled there automatically.</p></li>
				<li><p>At the position where the liquid manure barrel should refill (hence the transporter should stop), there needs to be a waiting point.</p></li>

He will continue until the shovel is full, then stop and set the shovel to the <span class="emphasize2">transport position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelTransport inline"></span>).

			<p>Four waypoints before waiting point #3 the driver will set the shovel to the <span class="emphasize2">pre-unloading position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelPreUnloading inline"></span>) and start looking for a bunker or a trailer to unload to.

			<p>If filling into a trailer, the trailer does not have to be exactly at/behind waiting point #3, it can in fact be situated slightly in front of it.

			<h2>Generating a course</h2>
			<p>For general descriptions of the settings, see <a href="#hud_courseGeneration" class="internal"><span class="icon-page8 inline"></span>HUD: Course generation</a>.</p>
			<p>In order to generate a field course (for the field work and fertilizing/seeding modes) automatically, the following steps need to be done.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>If the field scanner is activated, choose a field edge path from the list. If no field is selected, the currently loaded course (if present) is used as a field edge path.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the work width. The work width is needed to calculated the distance between the course's lanes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the starting corner. Depending on the size and form of the field and the chosen starting direction, the starting point's position can be in different places:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="../../res/img/manual_generateCourse_startingCorners_en.jpg" class="infoImg">
						<figcaption>Two possible starting positions with a "north east" starting corner</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the starting direction. That's the direction that the first lane will have.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="emphasize2">(optional)</span><br />
					Activate/deactivate <code>Return to first point</code>. If activated, the driver will drive to the starting point (instead of the end point) when the used tool is full (field work mode)/empty (fertilizer and seeding mode). This can be useful if the unloading/refilling course begins at the starting point.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="../../res/img/manual_generateCourse_returnToFirstPoint_en.jpg" class="infoImg">
						<figcaption>The driver returns to the starting instead of the stopping at the end point</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>This settings will be hard coded into the course, meaning it can not be changed dynamically while the course is being driven.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="emphasize2">(optional)</span><br />
					Set your headland options. Courseplay currently supports a maximum of six lanes, which can be either <span class="icon-headlandBefore inline"></span> before (e.g. with a combine) or <span class="icon-headlandAfter inline"></span> after (e.g. with a cultivator) the field course. If the headland is set to "before", it will start approximately at the set starting corner. If it's set to "after", the field course will continue directly into the headland lane.</p>
					<p>Also choose the direction of the headland: <span class="icon-headlandClockwise2 inline" title="Headland direction button"></span> clockwise or <span class="icon-headlandCounterClockwise2 inline" title="Headland direction button"></span> counter-clockwise</p>
					<p>Depending on the size and form of the field, the set starting corner and start direction, it can happen that the headland begins at a point where there are multiple waypoints close by (e.g. the field course's points). This can lead to the driver not always finding waypoint #1. Should this happen, you can set <code>Start course at first point</code> on the <a href="#hud_driverControls" class="internal"><span class="icon-page1 inline"></span> Driver controls</a> page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Click the <span class="icon-page8 inline" title="generate course button"></span> generate course button.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="../../res/img/manual_generateCourse_generatedCourse.jpg" class="infoImg">
						<figcaption>A generated course with one lane of headland</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>If the <span class="icon-page8 inline" title="generate course button"></span> generate course button is disabled, you should check if all requirements are met:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A valid field edge path / a course with at least <span class="emphasize2">5 waypoints</span> must be loaded (when headland is activated, the course has to have at least <span class="emphasize2">20 waypoints</span>)</li>
						<li>The loaded course has not been generated</li>
						<li>The loaded course has not been combined from multiple courses</li>
						<li>A starting corner has been set</li>
						<li>A starting direction has been set</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The waiting points at the start and the end will be set automatically. If you want to add an unloading/refilling course, the field course must be generated first. Afterwards, add the unloading/refilling course.</p>
